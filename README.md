#32feet.NET - Personal Area Networking for .NET

32feet.NET is a shared-source project to make personal area networking technologies such as Bluetooth, Infrared (IrDA) and more, easily accessible from .NET code. Supports desktop, mobile or embedded systems. 32feet.NET is free for commercial or non-commercial use. If you use the binaries you can just use the library as-is, if you make modifications to the source you need to include the 32feet.NET License.txt document and ensure the file headers are not modified/removed. The project currently consists of the following libraries:
* Bluetooth
* IrDA
* Object Exchange

Bluetooth support requires a device with either the Microsoft, Widcomm, BlueSoleil, or Stonestreet One Bluetopia Bluetooth stack. Requires .NET Compact Framework v3.5 or above and Windows CE.NET 4.2 or above, or .NET Framework v3.5 for desktop Windows XP, Vista, 7 and 8. A subset of functionality is available for Windows Phone 8 and Windows Embedded Handheld 8 in the InTheHand.Phone.Bluetooth.dll library.
